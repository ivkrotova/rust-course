# Rust Course

Working through the Yandex Rust course. This repo tracks my progress and keeps notes on everything I'm learning along the way.

## What's Here

- **[LEARNING_NOTES.md](LEARNING_NOTES.md)** – running notes on Rust concepts, tools, and patterns
- **src/** – code exercises and examples

## Tools

Using the standard Rust toolchain:
- `clippy` for linting
- `rustfmt` for formatting

## Progress

Just getting started. Will update as I go.
