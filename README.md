# Rust Course

Working through the Yandex Rust course. This repo tracks my progress and keeps notes on everything I'm learning along the way.

## What's Here

- **[notes/](notes/)** – learning notes on Rust concepts, tools, and best practices
- **src/** – code exercises and examples

## Tools

Using the standard Rust toolchain:
- `clippy` for linting
- `rustfmt` for formatting

## Progress

Just getting started. Will update as I go.

## Setup

Install git hooks:
`chmod +x hooks/pre-commit`
`ln -s ../../hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit`
